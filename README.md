# Matrix theme for VSCODE
## Based on Matrix Revolution

This theme is based on a cover image of matrix revolution.

There is no pure green color here, nor any pure color. All combinations of colors are thought to be pleasure to the eyes using paletes.

If you have sensible eyes as I have and your sights feel tired to code at the night this theme is for you.

*The matrix has you*

*Follow the write habbit... noc, noc*

### Get started

Copy the json file inside the write rabbit limit and past it inside your `"workbench.colorCustomizations": {}` from *settings.json* file of your vscode.
It is located at *Menu Bar --> File --> Preferences --> Settings --> Workbench --> Appearance --> Edit in settings.json*

Currently I'm working on the customization of the variables, parameters, comments colors.
